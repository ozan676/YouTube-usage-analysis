### Motivation
  
  In the modern era, social media has become an indispensable part of daily life. Every day, we encounter numerous images and videos on the internet, each differing in the platforms we use to access them. For me, YouTube stands out as the most significant social media platform among others. The reason is straightforward: while it is possible to meet individuals who do not use Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, or other social media platforms, it is highly unlikely to encounter someone who does not use YouTube. In other words, the probability of meeting a person who does not use YouTube is lower than the probability of meeting someone who doesn't use Instagram, Twitter, and so forth.

This observation is supported by data from globalmediainsight.com, which reports that YouTube has over 2.7 billion monthly active users as of November 2024. Additionally, only Facebook surpasses YouTube in terms of active user numbers. These statistics, combined with my personal experiences, highlight the pervasive influence of YouTube. Whether for educational purposes—such as researching a topic—or for entertainment, like watching videos, YouTube is a go-to platform.

This widespread usage led me to reflect on my own interaction with YouTube. I began to question how I utilize the platform: Do I watch more videos or listen to music? What topics do I engage with the most? How many hours do I spend actively watching YouTube each day? Do I tend to use YouTube more in the mornings or evenings? These questions motivated me to analyze my YouTube usage data to seek answers and gain a deeper understanding of my viewing habits. Furthermore I will try to find relations between my Youtube usage and daily life

### Data Source

I downloaded my YouTube data from Google Takeout. The exported data includes the following components:

Watch History: A record of all the videos I have watched on YouTube.
Search History: A log of all the search queries I have entered on YouTube.
Subscribed Channels: A list of all the channels I am subscribed to.
Playlists: Details of all my created and saved playlists.
The data is provided in JSON format, covering my activity from [start date] to [end date]. To prepare the data for analysis, I plan to perform the following preprocessing steps:
### Data Processing
Data Cleaning: Remove any duplicate entries and irrelevant data points.
Data Transformation: Convert JSON files to CSV format for easier manipulation using data analysis tools.
Data Integration: Combine different data components to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
### Data Analysis

For the analysis, I will use Python and its data analysis libraries such as pandas and matplotlib to visualize my YouTube usage patterns. This data will help answer the following research questions:

Do I watch more videos or listen to music on YouTube?
What are the most common topics I engage with?
How many hours do I spend actively watching YouTube each day?
Do I tend to use YouTube more in the mornings or evenings?
How does my YouTube usage correlate with my daily life activities?
